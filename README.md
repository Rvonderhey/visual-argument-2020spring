Paint-
My visual argument was inspired by common advertisements for paint. The argument is to inspire creativity through art. I am by 
no means an artist or a graphic designer, but it was still fun creating the image of paint spilling over the letters. By 
the time I was finished, I felt like I had enough experience to create something meaningful in Gimp. Before this project, I 
was brand new to image editing For my first try, I am pretty happy with the outcome.
